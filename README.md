# ProSim

This repository contains my solution to Assignment 1 for the Operating Systems course (CSCI 3120, Summer 2025) at Dalhousie University.

## Description

`prosim` is a C-based program simulator that interprets and executes program descriptions composed of the following primitives: `DOOP`, `BLOCK`, `LOOP`, `END`, and `HALT`. It simulates execution time and prints detailed outputs for each step.

## Build

```bash
gcc -o prosim prosim.c
